# Url Shortener App

This project is a url shortener meant to clone behavior of Bitly. You can enter in your long url in the textfield and click the button to generate a short link which can be clicked and will redirect you to the long url. It is persistent using Supabase for the cloud hosted db, so you can also take that url elsewhere to use and have it redirect to your chosen source. It is deployed via a Vercel project so it can be used live.

I started this as a back end only project to learn about how Bitly works. Then I decided it would be fun to make it into a whole application. Enjoy!
